# Elbm
This repository contains the code for implementing efficient binary multiplication algorithms on CPU. 
Binary multiplication is an essential operation in computer arithmetic, 
and efficient algorithms can significantly improve the performance of multiplication operations in various applications.

## Example

Clone the directory using the ```recursive``` flag. Then, run

```
mkdir build && cd build 
cmake ..
make -j
```

Run ```build/perf_1bit_vs_1bit -h``` to see the execution options.
